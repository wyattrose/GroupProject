# JavaFX Notes!

## JavaFX public API

The top layer of JavaFX architecture contains a JavaFX public API which provides all the necessary classes that are responsible for executing a full featured JavaFX application. The list of all the packages are as follows:

* javafx.animation (provides the set of classes that are responsible for transistions based on animations)
* javafx.application (provides application life-cycle methods)
* javafx.collections (provides classes that can handle collections and related utilites)
* javafx.concurrent (provides classes that are responsible for multitasking)
* javafx.embed.swing (provides the set of classes that can be used inside the swing code)
* javafx.embed.swt (provides the set of classes that can be used inside the swt code)
* java.event (provides the classes that deal with events and their handling)
* javafx.fxml (Contains the set of classes that are responsible of loading hierarchy from marku-up)
* javafx.geometry (provides the 2D classes that contains the methods to operate 2D geometry on the object)
* javafx.scene (provides the classes to deal with scene graph API)
* javafx.scene.canvas (provides the set of classes that deal with the canvas)
* javafx.scene.control (contains the classes for all JavaFX components)
* javafx.scene.effect (contains the set of classes that apply the grpahic effects to scene graph nodes)
* javafx.scene.image (provides the set of classes for loading and displaying images)
* javafx.scene.input (provides the set of classes for the mouse and keyboard events)
* javafx.scene.layout (provides the set of classes to support user interface layout)
* javafx.scene.media (provides the set of classes to integrate audio and video into JavaFX application)
* javafx.scene.paint (provides the set of classes for colours and gradients to fill shapes and backgrounds when redning scene graph)
* javafx.scene.shape (provides the set of 2D classes that performs the operations on objects related to 2D geometry)
* javafx.scene.text (provides the set of classes for fonts and rendering text nodes)
* javafx.scene.transform (provides the set of classes that are used to perform rotating, scaling, shearing operations on object)
* javafx.scene.web (provides means for loading and displaying web content)
* javafx.stage (provides the top level container classes for JavaFX content)
* javafx.util (provides utilities classes)
javafx.util.container (this package is for standard  string converters for JavaFX)
